## [0.4.0] - Previous Release
- Legacy Telnet/Binary protocol support
- Basic outlet control and monitoring
- Load shedding and sequencing features
- Initial HACS support

---

## Migration Guide from 0.4.x to 1.0.0

### Automatic Migration
- Existing Telnet configurations will continue working unchanged
- No breaking changes to existing automation or entity IDs
- All current features remain available

### Recommended Upgrades
1. **Switch to Redfish**: Enable modern API for faster updates
2. **Enable Hybrid Mode**: Get best of both worlds
3. **Add to Energy Dashboard**: Leverage new power monitoring features
4. **Update Automations**: Use new power sensors for advanced control

### New Installation
1. Install via HACS (recommended)
2. Choose connection type during setup:
   - **Auto-detect**: Let the integration choose (recommended)
   - **Redfish**: Modern REST API (fast, secure)
   - **Telnet**: Legacy protocol (stable, vendor features)
3. Enable vendor features if needed (load shedding, sequencing)
4. Add to Home Assistant Energy Dashboard
